## What is Heather? Why is Heather?

Heather is a 3D printed Highland cow (plural: Heathers). She’s also a [SAO (Shitty Add-On)](https://hackaday.io/project/52950-shitty-add-ons)—a tiny hardware trinket designed to plug into compatible badge headers at conferences like the [Open Hardware Summit 2025](https://2025.oshwa.org/) in Edinburgh, Scotland. She is open source. She is adorable. She is questionably constructed. She is held together by Emotional Support & Stability Pins (ESSPs). Do not ask her to do more.
